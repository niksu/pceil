Description:
This implementation was a small experiment to explore how to translate
TPTP-encoded proofs produced by the E theorem-prover, into Isar
scripts which can be checked using Isabelle/HOL.

The file pceil contains the implementation.  It's incomplete and
unpolished. If I were to redo this, I would probably implement it in
Prolog rather than Python.  TPTP problems are encoded in Prolog
syntax, are readable using read/1, and therefore can readily
be obtained as data within Prolog.

Test data is included in e_proofs.tgz, generated by E 1.8 from
problems in TPTP collection version 5.4.0.
